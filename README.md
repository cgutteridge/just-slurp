The script will produce a list of food as a simple text file suitable for grep to find that exact chilli chicken you wanted, but couldn't remember the name of the takeaway. Give it the "area" URL to start it off.

I've included the MACOS version of phantomjs. If on linux you may need to get a different version and alter the path the the binary in the just-slurp script.

To run the script, give it an "area" URL from just-eat. Suggested use:

  ./just-slurp https://www.just-eat.co.uk/area/so17-portswood > noms.txt
